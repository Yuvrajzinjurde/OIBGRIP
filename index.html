            <h2>Computer networks</h2>
            <p>
                A computer network is a group of interconnected computers and devices that are able to communicate and exchange data with each other. The main purpose of a computer network is to enable communication and resource sharing between different devices, such as printers, servers, and personal computers.

                Computer networks can be classified based on their size and scope. Local Area Networks (LANs) are networks that cover a small geographical area, typically within a single building or campus. Wide Area Networks (WANs) cover larger areas, such as cities or even countries, and connect LANs together. The Internet is an example of a global WAN.
                
                The communication between devices in a network can be accomplished through different protocols and technologies. Some of the most common network protocols include Ethernet, TCP/IP, and Wi-Fi. Network technologies include wired and wireless connections, such as Ethernet cables, fiber optic cables, and Wi-Fi routers.
                
                Computer networks have revolutionized the way we communicate and share information. They have enabled new applications and services, such as online shopping, social media, and video conferencing. They have also made it easier for people to work together remotely and collaborate on projects. As technology continues to evolve, computer networks will play an increasingly important role in our daily lives.
